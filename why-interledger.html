          <h2>The Problem</h2>

          <p>Payment networks today are siloed and disconnected. Payments are relatively easy within one country or if the sender and recipient have accounts on the same network or ledger. Try sending to someone on a different system though, and you may be out of luck. Where connections between ledgers do exist, they are manual, slow or expensive.</p>

          <h2>Applying the Architecture of the Internet</h2>

          <!-- This paragraph is lacking punch, why people really think the Internet is so great -->

          <p>The power of the Internet comes from the fact that it is not one network or system. The Internet is a network of networks, enabled by open protocols like TCP/IP for sending packets of information across independent telecommunications networks. This makes it easy to communicate with anyone, no matter what provider they are connected to. Can we do the same for money?</p>

          <h2>The Protocol for the Internet of Value</h2>

          <p>Interledger is an open suite of protocols for connecting ledgers of all types: from digital wallets and national payment systems to blockchains and beyond. This will make it easy to transact with anyone, no matter where we live or what type of money we use. Sending value will be as easy as sending information is today. This is the vision of the Internet of Value.</p>

          <h2>Why Now</h2>

          <p>Interledger is based on concepts dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, but it took the advent of Bitcoin and the global blockchain movement to make the world realize that money and banking could be reinvented. We have seen the power of the Internet to unleash human ingenuity. Now it's time to see what the principles of the Internet can do for commerce and money.</p>

          <p>We can't wait to see what you build on Interledger.</p>
